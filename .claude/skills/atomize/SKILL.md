description: Build 1 — atomize one piece of Muxin's original content into cheap platform assets (text posts + quote cards) and a review queue. Video shorts are a separate skill — /video. Usage - /atomize <substack-url | file | audio-file | pasted text>, or /atomize --revise <content-folder>.

# /atomize — content atomization pipeline

Turn ONE piece of Muxin's original content into platform-specific assets, scored and queued
for review. Muxin wrote the thinking; you package it.

**Scope:** `/atomize` handles the **cheap, high-volume** derivatives — text posts and quote
cards — so you can run it on everything. Turning a piece into a **video short is the separate,
deliberate `/video` skill** (script → storyboard → review → render); it's heavier and costs
real money, so it's opt-in per piece, not bundled here.

## The extraction-first rule (non-negotiable)

- Derivatives are built from **verbatim sentences** in the source. You may trim, tighten, and
  reformat for the platform. You may NOT compose new claims, arguments, metaphors, or
  worldview statements in Muxin's voice.
- Every derivative carries `source_lines` frontmatter listing the source.md line numbers its
  text came from. If you can't point at lines, you wrote it — delete it.
- If the source is too thin to atomize honestly, say so and stop. Do not pad.

## Voice & AI tells (non-negotiable — CLAUDE.md rule 5)

Read `config/voice.yaml` before you draft or edit ANY text below. It applies to every
derivative, the video script, and the video title/description. The short version:

- **No em dashes.** Normalize them to periods, commas, colons, or parentheses. This holds even
  for verbatim extractions: keep Muxin's words, change the dash. (Muxin's source essays use em
  dashes; the published derivatives must not.)
- **No AI tells:** "here's the thing", "it's not just X, it's Y", "let's unpack", "delve",
  "leverage", "unlock", rhetorical-question hooks, emoji bullets, reflexive triads. See the full
  banned list in `config/voice.yaml`.
- Muxin sounds like a working PM thinking out loud: plain, direct, specific, contrarian when
  earned, never performing. Read each draft aloud before queueing it.

## Steps

1. **Ingest.** `npm run new-content -- <arg>` → prints the content folder path. (Audio files
   are transcribed automatically via the configured provider.) Read `source.md`.
   - When Muxin **pastes a raw body of text** instead of a URL/file/audio path, pipe it to
     the script via stdin using a quoted heredoc so the text (backticks, `$`, quotes) is
     passed literally:
     ```
     npm run new-content -- --text <<'ATOMIZE_EOF'
     <the pasted body, verbatim>
     ATOMIZE_EOF
     ```
     The title is derived from the first `# heading` or the first non-empty line, so a
     `# Title` line at the top of the paste helps.

2. **Read the latest strategy brief** in `briefs/` (highest date). Apply its
   `Directives for atomization` — pillar priority, channel emphasis, format notes, hooks that
   worked. **Record which brief and which directives you acted on** in each derivative's
   frontmatter (`from_brief`, `directives_applied`, see step 4) — that attribution is what lets
   `/publish` log the bet and `/strategy` later grade whether it paid off. If no brief exists,
   proceed with defaults and note that in the review queue header.

3. **Tag + extract.** Identify the pillar(s) (rubric: `config/pillars.yaml`). List the 5–10
   most quotable/claimable sentences with their line numbers. Write these to
   `<folder>/extracts.md` — this is the working material for every derivative (and for `/video`
   later, if this piece becomes a short).

3.5. **Route — decide which platforms this piece is for.** Run
   `npm run route -- --pillar <pillar> --folder <folder>` (once per tagged pillar). It writes
   `<folder>/routing.md` and prints the include/skip decision per platform, informed by the
   analytics (which platforms are receptive to this pillar) plus `config/routing.yaml`. Only
   generate text derivatives in step 4 for platforms the router marked **`include`**; do not
   produce assets for `skip` platforms — the point is to post where it makes sense, not
   everywhere. If the piece spans two pillars, run the router per pillar and include a platform
   if **either** pillar includes it. Layer the strategy brief (step 2) on top: the brief may
   tighten further, but don't re-add a data-skipped platform without a stated reason.
   Cold-start platforms come back `include` with low confidence — that's expected; routing
   tightens as data accrues.

4. **Generate text derivatives** into `<folder>/derivatives/` per `config/platforms.yaml`
   (counts and style there), **only for the platforms `routing.md` marked `include`**:
   - `x-1.md … x-5.md`, `linkedin-1.md`, `bluesky-1.md` — skip any of these whose platform the
     router excluded (e.g. no `linkedin-1.md` if LinkedIn was skipped for this pillar).
   - Community variants ONLY where routing **and** the brief agree there's a reason to post,
     e.g. `community-democratic-resilience.md`. Respect `config/platforms.yaml` community notes
     (ABC Builders: observe-only unless brief says otherwise).
   - `quote-card-1.md` (a verbatim quotable line) — drives the quote-card asset (step 7).
   - File format:
     ```markdown
     ---
     platform: x            # x | linkedin | bluesky | community | quote-card
     option: 1
     source_lines: [12, 31-33]
     scores: { native: 4, brand: 5, cta: true }
     cta: source            # source | <literal-url> | none — stamped from config/cta.yaml (step 4.5)
     cta_label: "Full essay (free to subscribe):"   # short lead-in for the link; omit when cta is none
     from_brief: briefs/2026-06-14-strategy-brief.md   # the brief whose directives shaped this (or omit if none)
     directives_applied: [prioritize_pillar:claude-code, format:short-single]  # which directives you acted on
     ---
     <the post text — nothing else>
     ```
   - Text derivatives are ALWAYS Claude-authored and extraction-first. Do NOT pass them
     through `text-polish` — that provider (Grok) is reserved for video scripts, which now live
     in the `/video` skill.

4.5. **Stamp the CTA** (`config/cta.yaml`). The funnel: convert rented attention into owned
   audience. For each text derivative set `cta` + `cta_label` from the target for THAT
   derivative's pillar — human-ai / claude-code / other → `cta: source` (a "read more" link to
   the essay itself; `/publish` resolves it from source.md `canonical_url`, falling back to the
   Substack home when there's no essay URL); civic-tech (and community rooms posting civic
   content) → the voting tool URL. A piece that spans pillars: choose per derivative (e.g. a
   civic-leaning Bluesky take on a human-ai essay may point at the voting tool). If a derivative
   isn't a "go read the essay" invite, you may set its `cta` to a literal url or `none` instead.
   **Never write the link into the post body** — `/publish` places it per platform from
   `cta.yaml` `placement` (X → first reply, LinkedIn → first comment, Bluesky/community →
   inline), so the body stays clean and dodges the in-post link penalty. The `quote-card`
   carries its CTA inside the asset itself — leave its `cta` as `none` here.
   Donations are never the headline ask; the default CTA is "come read / subscribe."
   - **Check `canonical_url`.** If source.md has no `canonical_url` (a local draft, not yet
     published), tell Muxin to paste the published essay URL into source.md before `/publish` —
     otherwise every `cta: source` link falls back to the Substack home instead of the essay.

5. **Score honestly** (the frontmatter `scores`):
   - `native`: does this read like a real human post on that platform? (1–5)
   - `brand`: does it represent human-centered AI values? (1–5)
   - `cta`: does it point somewhere useful? (true/false — CTA is optional, not mandatory)
   - Score 1–2 → discard it yourself rather than queueing junk.

6. **Validate.** `npm run validate -- <folder>` — must pass before queueing. Fix violations,
   don't relax limits.

7. **Generate the quote-card asset** (cheap, extraction-first):
   - `npm run render -- --still <folder> --quote quote-card-1`
   - **Image model policy — cost-first, escalate only on request, NEVER automatically.** Default
     is **Riverflow** (~$0.02). If Muxin dislikes a result, do NOT silently switch to a pricier
     model — **offer first**: *"we can try a different prompt on Riverflow, or step up to a more
     expensive model."* Only on his yes, re-render with `--pro` (Nano Banana Pro ~$0.13) or
     `--hero` (gpt-5.4-image-2 ~$0.23). (Free option for flat conceptual spots: hand-author an
     SVG → `remotion-svg` path / `/bakeoff`.)

   **Video shorts are a separate skill.** `/atomize` no longer scripts or renders video — that
   keeps it cheap (text + quote cards). To turn this piece into a short, run **`/video <folder>`**
   (script → storyboard → review → render).

8. **Queue for review.** Ensure `<folder>/review-queue.md` has one row per asset that was
   generated — the routing `include` text platforms plus the quote card
   (id, platform, format, asset path, scores, status=pending). Then STOP. Do not publish.
   Tell Muxin: the folder path, asset counts, which platforms routing skipped (and why, per
   `routing.md`), and anything else skipped. If Muxin wants a skipped platform anyway, they can
   say so (or adjust `config/routing.yaml`) and you'll generate it. If the piece is a good
   candidate for a short, mention they can run `/video <folder>`.

## --revise mode

`/atomize --revise <folder>`: read `review-queue.md`, find rows with status `revise`, and act
by `format`:
- **Text derivatives / quote cards**: re-draft ONLY those using the `notes` column as
  instruction (extraction-first still applies), re-validate.
Reset revised rows to `pending`, re-validate, and report. (storyboard / short rows are revised
with `/video --revise <folder>`.)
